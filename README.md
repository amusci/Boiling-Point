*"Hello there mate. So you want to hack, and have found my files. Well, there's no place to start but at the beginning."*

**NFM2 is programmed with JAVA!** If you have no idea what that is, or are scratching your head at what programming is, you definitely need to look over
these pages linked below. Even if you have basic knowledge from some project or class you took once, 
reading through these will help you avoid ERRORS!!!

- [Java - Basic Datatypes](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/java_basic_datatypes.htm)
- [Java - Variable Types](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/java_variable_types.htm)
- [Java - Basic Operators](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/java_basic_operators.htm)
- [Java - Methods](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/java_methods.htm)

That is the BARE MINIMUM. Feel free to browse around that site a bit more. You won't encounter much more than the above in NFM's files, but it doesn't hurt to know.

So now that know a bit about what NFM is "made" of, what do you need to hack it? First off, you need Java, specifically something called the _Java Runtime Environment_. This is the Java you download to play games. You probably have this already.  
Next you need the _Java Development Kit_. This is what BlueJ and Eclipse use to compile Java source code into an actual game.  
**_BlueJ_** is sort of like a text editor, like Word, and it'll be what we use to hack NFM.  
**_Eclipse_** is the most advanced Java editing tool available, and it is much more feature-rich then BlueJ, though it may look a bit complicated to a new user.  
**_7-zip_** is the last program you need. It'll help you navigate through NFM files. **_WinRAR_** will also work as long as you know what you're doing.

Now that you got that, it's time to get into what makes my files special!!! ♥♥♥

These files are FIXED and READY TO HACK!!! They already contain a project file for both BlueJ and Eclipse, double-click and you can begin hacking immediately!

The following is what has been done:

 - Most NFMM graphics (except for sparks and new dust)
 - NFMM Car Maker codes work correctly
 - Floating ```set()``` and ```chk()``` hack
 - Helpful methods: e.g. ```colorinvert()```, ```paintcs()```, ```imagefilter()``` 
 - Bug fixing! (e.g. DragShot's fixed ```sortcars()```, Readded ```savecookie()``` and ```readcookie()```, improved ```drag[]``` alternative)

This is what is to come:

- 100% NFMM graphics
- More bug fixes
- Add in as many enhancements as I can to make hacking easier and fun!
